# Chapter4-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
on this project, have 2 task, first,  Creating the best prediction model to predict “Churn Status in Banking”, it must have >86% accuracy for predict, and second Creating the best number of clusters for “Random Points”

## Assignment Outcomes :
● Participants can segment data using the clustering method
● Participants can carry out and compare several Supervised Learning models
● Participants can design and create a simple neural network (not a CNN, but with a perceptron model) for the MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset


### Task 1
Creating the best prediction model to predict “Churn Status in Banking”.

*** Scoring ***
● Getting Best Accuracy > 86% : 100
● Getting Best Accuracy 85% - 86%: 85
● Getting Best Accuracy 84% - 85%: 70
● Getting Best Accuracy <84% : 55
● Any error in the code will become 0.


### Task 2
Creating the best number of clusters for “Random Points”

*** Scoring ***
● Getting Best Silhouette Score > 70: 100
● Getting Best Silhouette Score 65-70: 85
● Getting Best Silhouette Score 60-65: 70
● Getting Best Silhouette Score <65: 55
● Any error in the code will become 0.

### Task 3
Deep Learning for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using PyTorch. This is an exploration task. Develop your end-to-end workflow for solving a Handwritten Digit Classification task using Neural Network architecture (not Convolutional Neural Network).

### Bonuses Task
This problem description is the same as Task 3. But there are some technical challenges that you have to choose one.
1. Compare 3 different configurations while your model is wider/deeper. Show and explain the performance result.
2. Compare 3 configurations for different Loss Function. Show and explain your performance result.
3. Compare 3 configurations for the activation function. Show and explain your performance result.


In challenge 3, Task 1, this time we preprocessed data, cleaned data, and correlated data to create a good data set, and trained the data into 3 machine learning models using different methods, in this challenge I used the Random Forest method , Naive Bayes, and Linear Regression, and compare which method has better accuracy.

then in Task 2, create the best cluster using the KMeans method, from the available dataset

Task 3, Create Machine Learning that has Deep Learning using Neural Network Architecture, which is supported by the Pytorch library, to identify handwritten classification digits taken from the MNIST library (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)

Finally, Task 4, is an additional bonus question which asks us to create 3 different configurations which will later be compared, as well as with the loss and activation functions, create 3 different configurations between the two.
